Beyond FPGA security and IoT systems, I spend a significant amount of time thinking about **how we think**.

This page is my evolving collection of ideas on:

- Decision-making
- Communication
- Learning
- Research habits
- Building clarity in complex systems

## Why This Matters to Me

Security research is not just about code, hardware, or protocols.  

It is about:

- Understanding adversarial behavior  
- Modeling uncertainty  
- Communicating risk clearly  
- Designing systems that humans can actually operate safely  

That requires more than technical knowledge — it requires structured thinking.

## Books That Have Influenced Me

Some books that shaped how I approach research and communication:

- **How Emotions Are Made** — Lisa Feldman Barrett  
- **Thinking, Fast and Slow** — Daniel Kahneman  
- **The Tell-Tale Brain** — V.S. Ramachandran  
- **Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect** — Matthew Lieberman  

These works influence how I:

- interpret experimental results  
- think about bias in evaluation  
- communicate technical ideas to different audiences  


## Podcasts & Voices I Learn From

Beyond books, I regularly listen to podcasts that explore psychology, neuroscience, performance, and communication. These shape how I think about research, resilience, and leadership.

- **Mel Robbins**  
  Practical tools for confidence, decision-making, and overcoming hesitation. Her frameworks on action and momentum resonate strongly during thesis-writing and job transitions.

- **Dr. Wendy Suzuki**  
  Neuroscientist focused on brain plasticity, exercise, and memory. Her work reinforces how cognitive performance is trainable and how stress can be reframed productively.

- **Dr. Tara Swart**  
  Insights on neuroplasticity, mindset, and how thoughts shape long-term outcomes. Helpful in thinking about habits and sustained research productivity.

- **Vanessa Van Edwards**  
  Science-based communication strategies, non-verbal cues, and interpersonal intelligence — extremely relevant when presenting research or teaching.

- **Rob Dial**  
  Deep dives into mindset, discipline, and clarity. His reflections often connect strongly with long-term goal setting and resilience during challenging research phases.

These voices influence how I approach:

- Handling reviewer feedback constructively  
- Communicating technical ideas with clarity  
- Managing stress and cognitive load  
- Maintaining consistency in long-term projects

## How I Organize My Research Thinking

I treat research like a layered system:

### 1. Technical Layer
- Code
- Experiments
- Hardware validation
- Performance metrics

### 2. Conceptual Layer
- Threat models
- Assumptions
- Failure boundaries
- Generalization limits

### 3. Communication Layer
- Can I explain this in 3 sentences?
- Can a non-expert understand the risk?
- Does the framing reflect the real-world impact?

## Long-Term Goal

To build systems that are:

- Secure by design  
- Efficient under constraint  
- Understandable by humans  

And to communicate those systems clearly.
