summary: Graduate symposium talk on a dynamic anomaly detection framework that complements formal verification for FPGA security.
abstract: |
  Existing formal verification techniques for FPGA designs are powerful but often fail to capture runtime vulnerabilities and environment-dependent behaviors. This work proposes a dynamic anomaly detection framework for FPGA security that monitors runtime behavior and injects controlled anomalies to surface subtle security issues. By combining behavioral modeling with targeted perturbations, the framework complements formal verification, leading to a more comprehensive assessment of FPGA-based systems deployed in IoT and cyber-physical settings.
