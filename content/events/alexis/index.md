summary: Seminar on Alexis, an autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework for FPGA bitstream data.
abstract: |
  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems but remain vulnerable to hardware Trojans and side-channel attacks. This talk introduces "Alexis", an anomaly detection framework that trains an autoencoder on FPGA bitstream data to identify deviations indicative of malicious modification or faults. By working directly on bitstream representations, Alexis complements traditional verification and enhances runtime security monitoring.
