summary: Department seminar presenting ENVOT, an ensemble-learning-based IoT swarm attestation framework.
abstract: |
  The growing deployment of IoT devices demands scalable and efficient security mechanisms. This talk presents ENVOT, a swarm attestation framework that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with ensemble learning to detect compromised devices using a compact RAM footprint. By extracting statistical and frequency-domain features and aggregating multiple models, ENVOT achieves high detection accuracy while significantly reducing verification latency and energy consumption, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT networks.
